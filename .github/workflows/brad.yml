# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "dev-branch" branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']

  pull_request:
    branches: ['dev-branch']

  pull_request_target:
    branches: ['dev-feature']

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Success!"

        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

        # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

        # Runs a single command using the runners shell

        # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
