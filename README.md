# [My Dev Workflow](https://)

__Description:__
As a software developer I have personally crafted these documents to work for me and my needs in use cases associated with my Workdays. The Tango Image links may start to change or become more updated as this solidification and my process may not need such links, but for now will serve me as this does give someone else some indication as to my work flow.
